# JS-CSS-Clock

I built a clock with a moving second-hand. 
I used the transition-timing-function so that the second hand will bounce over & back like a real mechanical second hand.

Things I learned while completing this app:
<ol>
  <li>transform and transition CSS properties</li>
<li>transition-timing-function </li>
  </ol>

Goals:
-Make it mobile responsive
